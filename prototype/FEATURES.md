# Missing Features

## ~~1. Fix All Repository Settings (not just description)~~ DONE

Implemented: `applyFixes()` batches all drifted repo fields (description, homepage, has_issues, has_projects, has_wiki, allow_merge_commit, allow_squash_merge, allow_auto_merge, delete_branch_on_merge, archived) into a single PATCH call. Topics use a separate PUT endpoint via `replaceTopics()`. Topics checking was also added (config, state, diff, fix). Default branch remains check-only.

## ~~2. Fix Security Settings~~ DONE

Implemented: `applyFixes()` now fixes all 4 security settings. Vulnerability alerts and automated security fixes each use dedicated PUT endpoints (`enableVulnerabilityAlerts()`, `enableAutomatedSecurityFixes()`). Secret scanning and push protection use a single PATCH call with a `security_and_analysis` payload via `updateRepository()`. All desired values are hardcoded to enabled.

## ~~3. Fix Workflow Settings~~ DONE

Implemented: `applyFixes()` now fixes workflow permissions drift. `GitHubClient.updateWorkflowPermissions()` sends a PUT to `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/permissions/workflow` with the desired state (`default_workflow_permissions: read`, `can_approve_pull_request_reviews: true`).

## ~~4. Fix Branch Protection~~ DONE

Implemented: `applyFixes()` now fixes branch protection drift for public repos. `GitHubClient.updateBranchProtection()` sends a PUT to `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection` with the full desired payload: `enforce_admins: true`, `required_linear_history: true`, `allow_force_pushes: false`, `required_status_checks` (strict: false, checks from `BASE_STATUS_CHECKS` + `RepositoryArgs.requiredStatusChecks()`), `required_pull_request_reviews: null`, `restrictions: null`. Both the "missing" and "drifted" cases are handled with a single PUT call.

## ~~5. Repository Rulesets~~ DONE

Implemented: `RulesetArgs` config defines desired rulesets (name, include patterns, required linear history, no force pushes, required status checks, required review count). `GitHubClient` has full CRUD: `listRulesets()` and `getRuleset()` for reading, `createRuleset()` for creation, `updateRuleset()` for updates. `OrgChecker.checkRulesets()` diffs each desired ruleset against actual state (missing rulesets, include patterns, rule settings, status checks, review count). `applyFixes()` creates missing rulesets via POST and updates drifted ones via PUT, using `buildRulesetRequest()` to construct the payload with target `branch`, enforcement `active`, and all configured rules/conditions.

## ~~6. GitHub Pages Validation and Fixing~~ DONE

Pages endpoint is queried and the github-pages environment is auto-created, but no actual Pages settings are validated (build type, source branch/path, HTTPS enforcement) and no fixes are applied.

## 7. Secret Creation via `--fix`

Secrets are checked for presence/absence but `--fix` does not create missing secrets.

### Plan

- Read `GITHUB_SECRETS` env var as a JSON map.
- Add `GitHubClient` methods:
  - GET `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/secrets/public-key` to get the repo public key.
  - PUT `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/secrets/{name}` to create/update a secret (libsodium sealed box encryption).
  - Same for environment secrets: `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/environments/{env}/secrets/{name}`.
- Key format from env var: `<repo>-<secret>` for action secrets, `<repo>-<env>-<secret>` for environment secrets.
- Add a dependency on a libsodium/NaCl library (e.g. `com.goterl:lazysodium-java`) for sealed box encryption.
- In `applyFixes()`, for each missing secret, look up value in the map and create it. If value not in map, report as unfixable.

## 8. Environment Fixes (reviewers, wait timer, deployment branches)

Environments are checked for existence and secret presence, but the spec requires managing reviewers, wait timers, and deployment branch policies. Fixing environments is also not implemented.

### Plan

- Extend `EnvironmentArgs` with fields: `reviewers`, `waitTimer`, `deploymentBranchPolicies`.
- Extend `Environment` record to capture these from the API response.
- Add diff logic for environment settings beyond just existence and secrets.
- Add `GitHubClient` methods:
  - PUT `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/environments/{name}` to create/update environments with full config.
  - POST/DELETE for deployment branch policies.
- Call from `applyFixes()`.

## 9. Immutable Releases Validation

`GitHubClient.getImmutableReleases()` exists but is never called in `computeDiffs()`.

### Plan

- Add `immutableReleases` boolean field to `RepositoryArgs`.
- In `computeDiffs()`, call `getImmutableReleases()` and compare against the desired value.
- In `applyFixes()`, call the endpoint to enable/disable immutable releases.
- Add `GitHubClient.updateImmutableReleases(owner, repo, enabled)`.

## 10. Owner as CLI Argument (not hardcoded)

The spec says the owner/org is a CLI argument. Currently it's hardcoded to "ArloL".

### Plan

- Parse the first positional CLI argument as the owner.
- Print usage and exit with code 1 if no owner is provided.
- Pass owner through to `OrgChecker` instead of using a hardcoded value.

## ~~11. Configurable Repo Groups with Defaults~~ DONE

Implemented: `RepositoryArgs.Builder` gained a `name(String)` setter (making `toBuilder()` usable as a group-defaults template) and an `addRequiredStatusChecks()` method that appends to the inherited list instead of replacing it. `GitHubCheck.repositories()` was reorganized into four named groups — `pagesSites` (6 repos sharing `.pages()`), `mainCiRepos` (9 repos sharing `main.required-status-check`), `individual` (unique configs), and `archived` — combined into a flat list via `Stream.of(...).flatMap(List::stream).toList()`. A new `RepositoryArgsTest` covers the builder additions.

## 12. Output: Show API Calls That `--fix` Would Make

The spec says the default (non-fix) output should show the API calls that `--fix` would make (e.g. `Would fix: PATCH /repos/...`).

### Plan

- After printing drifts for a repo, compute and print the API calls that would be made.
- Format: `Would fix: METHOD /path {payload}`.
- This requires the fix logic to be queryable without executing — extract fix plans as data before applying.

## 13. `--verbose` Flag

The spec mentions a `--verbose` flag. Not implemented.

### Plan

- Add `--verbose` CLI flag parsing alongside `--fix`.
- Pass verbosity to `OrgChecker`.
- In verbose mode, print additional detail: full API responses, request/response headers, rate limit status.

## 14. Allow Rebase Merge Check

The spec lists "Allow rebase merge" as a managed setting. The current `RepositoryArgs` has `allowMergeCommit` and `allowSquashMerge` but not `allowRebaseMerge`.

### Plan

- Add `allowRebaseMerge` field to `RepositoryArgs`.
- Add diff check comparing `RepositoryFull.allowRebaseMerge()` against config.
- Include in the PATCH payload for fixes.

## 15. Visibility Check and Fix

The spec lists visibility (public/private) as a managed setting. Not currently checked.

### Plan

- Add `visibility` field to `RepositoryArgs` (enum: PUBLIC, PRIVATE).
- Check `RepositoryFull.visibility()` or `isPrivate()` against desired value.
- Fix via PATCH `/repos/{owner}/{repo}` with `"visibility"` field.

## 16. Required Pull Request Reviews in Branch Protection

The spec lists "Required pull request reviews" as a branch protection setting. Not currently checked.

### Plan

- Add `requiredPullRequestReviews` config to `RepositoryArgs` (dismiss stale reviews, required approving review count, etc.).
- Parse from `BranchProtection` response.
- Add diff logic and include in branch protection update payload.

## 17. Branch Protection Restrictions

The spec lists "Restrictions" as a branch protection setting. Not currently checked.

### Plan

- Add `restrictions` config to `RepositoryArgs` (users, teams, apps that can push).
- Parse from `BranchProtection` response.
- Add diff logic and include in branch protection update payload.
